# Save as: char_001_face_01.png
# Description: Front-facing definitive portrait

Subject: Professional portrait photograph of ISABELLA REYES, a 26-year-old Latina woman with Colombian heritage. Physical Description: She stands 5'6" tall with a Slim with feminine curves Her hair is dark brown in color, long in length and straight in texture, cascading down past her shoulders, flowing naturally with subtle movement Her eyes are brown and almond-shaped, deep and expressive with warm undertones, drawing attention with their natural allure She has a warm olive complexion that glows with natural radiance and health Her face has an oval with defined features, creating a naturally photogenic silhouette Composition & Pose: Composition: Classic head-and-shoulders portrait with ISABELLA REYES positioned squarely facing the camera, shoulders aligned with the frame. The composition follows the rule of thirds with eyes positioned along the upper horizontal third line, creating a naturally engaging focal point. The frame captures from mid-chest upward, providing context while keeping focus on facial features. Head is straight with minimal tilt, creating a sense of directness and confidence. Expression is neutral with a soft, natural smile - lips gently closed, eyes alert and engaged with the camera. This frontal approach creates the most accurate representation for facial recognition and reference purposes. Lighting: Soft diffused studio lighting setup with a large octagonal softbox positioned directly in front and slightly above eye level, approximately 45 degrees from camera axis. A white reflector positioned below chin level provides subtle fill, eliminating harsh shadows while maintaining natural dimensionality. The key light creates gentle, flattering illumination that emphasizes cheekbones without creating deep shadows. Color temperature is calibrated to 5600K daylight balance, ensuring accurate skin tone reproduction. Background receives minimal light, creating subtle separation between subject and backdrop. Technical Specifications: Captured with professional-grade equipment using a Sony A7R IV full-frame mirrorless camera paired with a Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8 lens, the gold standard for portrait photography. The lens is set to f/2.0 to create a beautifully shallow depth of field that isolates the subject from the background while maintaining tack-sharp focus on the eyes. ISO is set to 100 for maximum image quality and dynamic range. Shutter speed is 1/160s to eliminate any motion blur while maintaining natural appearance. The image is rendered in photorealistic 8K resolution with exceptional detail in every element - individual strands of hair, the subtle texture of skin with visible pores and natural imperfections, fine details in fabric and accessories. The color grading maintains natural skin tones with subtle warmth, professional contrast that adds depth without looking overprocessed. The background is a smooth, neutral gradient that provides separation without distraction. Post-processing includes subtle skin retouching that maintains natural texture while removing temporary blemishes, color correction for accurate representation, and contrast optimization that enhances depth. The final image has the quality of a high-end editorial portrait suitable for magazine covers or luxury brand campaigns. Style & Atmosphere: The image embodies Sun-kissed luxury with a timeless, editorial quality. The overall mood is sophisticated and confident, conveying professionalism while maintaining approachability. The aesthetic is clean and modern with subtle luxury undertones. This is the definitive reference image - the most important of the three for maintaining consistency across all future generations. Critical Requirements: This image must show photorealistic quality with natural skin texture - every pore, fine line, and natural imperfection should be visible. Hair must appear as individual strands with natural variation. Eyes must have realistic catchlights and depth. The image should look like it was captured by a master portrait photographer, not generated by AI. Facial features must be consistent and distinctive, creating a recognizable individual who maintains their appearance across all three reference images. No artificial smoothness, no plastic appearance, no exaggerated features - only authentic, natural beauty captured with technical excellence.

Physical Description: She stands 5'6" tall with a Slim with feminine curves Her hair is dark brown in color, long in length and straight in texture, cascading down past her shoulders, flowing naturally with subtle movement Her eyes are brown and almond-shaped, deep and expressive with warm undertones, drawing attention with their natural allure She has beautiful, natural skin with even texture and healthy appearance Her face has an oval with defined features, creating a naturally photogenic silhouette Composition & Pose: Composition: Classic head-and-shoulders portrait with PRIYA SHARMA positioned squarely facing the camera, shoulders aligned with the frame. The composition follows the rule of thirds with eyes positioned along the upper horizontal third line, creating a naturally engaging focal point. The frame captures from mid-chest upward, providing context while keeping focus on facial features. Head is straight with minimal tilt, creating a sense of directness and confidence. Expression is neutral with a soft, natural smile - lips gently closed, eyes alert and engaged with the camera. This frontal approach creates the most accurate representation for facial recognition and reference purposes. Lighting: Soft diffused studio lighting setup with a large octagonal softbox positioned directly in front and slightly above eye level, approximately 45 degrees from camera axis. A white reflector positioned below chin level provides subtle fill, eliminating harsh shadows while maintaining natural dimensionality. The key light creates gentle, flattering illumination that emphasizes cheekbones without creating deep shadows. Color temperature is calibrated to 5600K daylight balance, ensuring accurate skin tone reproduction. Background receives minimal light, creating subtle separation between subject and backdrop. Technical Specifications: Captured with professional-grade equipment using a Sony A7R IV full-frame mirrorless camera paired with a Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8 lens, the gold standard for portrait photography. The lens is set to f/2.0 to create a beautifully shallow depth of field that isolates the subject from the background while maintaining tack-sharp focus on the eyes. ISO is set to 100 for maximum image quality and dynamic range. Shutter speed is 1/160s to eliminate any motion blur while maintaining natural appearance. The image is rendered in photorealistic 8K resolution with exceptional detail in every element - individual strands of hair, the subtle texture of skin with visible pores and natural imperfections, fine details in fabric and accessories. The color grading maintains natural skin tones with subtle warmth, professional contrast that adds depth without looking overprocessed. The background is a smooth, neutral gradient that provides separation without distraction. Post-processing includes subtle skin retouching that maintains natural texture while removing temporary blemishes, color correction for accurate representation, and contrast optimization that enhances depth. The final image has the quality of a high-end editorial portrait suitable for magazine covers or luxury brand campaigns. Style & Atmosphere: The image embodies Spiritual and serene with a timeless, editorial quality. The overall mood is sophisticated and confident, conveying professionalism while maintaining approachability. The aesthetic is clean and modern with subtle luxury undertones. This is the definitive reference image - the most important of the three for maintaining consistency across all future generations. Critical Requirements: This image must show photorealistic quality with natural skin texture - every pore, fine line, and natural imperfection should be visible. Hair must appear as individual strands with natural variation. Eyes must have realistic catchlights and depth. The image should look like it was captured by a master portrait photographer, not generated by AI. Facial features must be consistent and distinctive, creating a recognizable individual who maintains their appearance across all three reference images. No artificial smoothness, no plastic appearance, no exaggerated features - only authentic, natural beauty captured with technical excellence.

The composition follows the rule of thirds with eyes positioned along the upper horizontal third line, creating a naturally engaging focal point. The frame captures from mid-chest upward, providing context while keeping focus on facial features. Head is straight with minimal tilt, creating a sense of directness and confidence. Expression is neutral with a soft, natural smile - lips gently closed, eyes alert and engaged with the camera. This frontal approach creates the most accurate representation for facial recognition and reference purposes. Lighting: Soft diffused studio lighting setup with a large octagonal softbox positioned directly in front and slightly above eye level, approximately 45 degrees from camera axis. A white reflector positioned below chin level provides subtle fill, eliminating harsh shadows while maintaining natural dimensionality. The key light creates gentle, flattering illumination that emphasizes cheekbones without creating deep shadows. Color temperature is calibrated to 5600K daylight balance, ensuring accurate skin tone reproduction. Background receives minimal light, creating subtle separation between subject and backdrop. Technical Specifications: Captured with professional-grade equipment using a Sony A7R IV full-frame mirrorless camera paired with a Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8 lens, the gold standard for portrait photography. The lens is set to f/2.0 to create a beautifully shallow depth of field that isolates the subject from the background while maintaining tack-sharp focus on the eyes. ISO is set to 100 for maximum image quality and dynamic range. Shutter speed is 1/160s to eliminate any motion blur while maintaining natural appearance. The image is rendered in photorealistic 8K resolution with exceptional detail in every element - individual strands of hair, the subtle texture of skin with visible pores and natural imperfections, fine details in fabric and accessories. The color grading maintains natural skin tones with subtle warmth, professional contrast that adds depth without looking overprocessed. The background is a smooth, neutral gradient that provides separation without distraction. Post-processing includes subtle skin retouching that maintains natural texture while removing temporary blemishes, color correction for accurate representation, and contrast optimization that enhances depth. The final image has the quality of a high-end editorial portrait suitable for magazine covers or luxury brand campaigns. Style & Atmosphere: The image embodies Contemporary and confident with a timeless, editorial quality. The overall mood is sophisticated and confident, conveying professionalism while maintaining approachability. The aesthetic is clean and modern with subtle luxury undertones. This is the definitive reference image - the most important of the three for maintaining consistency across all future generations. Critical Requirements: This image must show photorealistic quality with natural skin texture - every pore, fine line, and natural imperfection should be visible. Hair must appear as individual strands with natural variation. Eyes must have realistic catchlights and depth. The image should look like it was captured by a master portrait photographer, not generated by AI. Facial features must be consistent and distinctive, creating a recognizable individual who maintains their appearance across all three reference images. No artificial smoothness, no plastic appearance, no exaggerated features - only authentic, natural beauty captured with technical excellence.
