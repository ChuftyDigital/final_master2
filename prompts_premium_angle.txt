### char_001 | ISABELLA REYES | IMAGE 02 ###
# Save as: char_001_face_02.png
# Description: Three-quarter angle showing dimensionality

Subject: Professional portrait photograph of ISABELLA REYES, a 26-year-old Latina woman with Colombian heritage. Physical Description: She stands 5'6" tall with a Slim with feminine curves Her hair is dark brown in color, long in length and straight in texture, cascading down past her shoulders, flowing naturally with subtle movement Her eyes are brown and almond-shaped, deep and expressive with warm undertones, drawing attention with their natural allure She has a warm olive complexion that glows with natural radiance and health Her face has an oval with defined features, creating a naturally photogenic silhouette Composition & Pose: Composition: Elegant three-quarter view with ISABELLA REYES's body at a 45-degree angle to the camera while head turns back toward the lens, creating a dynamic yet natural pose. This positioning reveals the full structure of the face while maintaining eye contact with the viewer. The composition emphasizes cheekbones and jawline through the angular perspective, adding dimension and visual interest. Shoulders remain relaxed with a subtle turn that creates elegant lines. Expression features a gentle, engaging smile that reaches the eyes, creating warmth and approachability. This angle is universally flattering and provides excellent reference for three-dimensional facial structure. Lighting: Rembrandt-style lighting with key light positioned at 45 degrees to the subject's left side and elevated 30 degrees above eye level. This creates the characteristic triangular highlight on the cheek opposite the light source, adding depth and dimension to the facial structure. A silver reflector on the shadow side provides controlled fill at approximately 2:1 lighting ratio. A subtle hair light from behind and above adds separation and dimension to the hair. The lighting sculpts the face, emphasizing cheekbones and creating a sense of three-dimensionality while maintaining a flattering, approachable quality. Technical Specifications: Captured with professional-grade equipment using a Sony A7R IV full-frame mirrorless camera paired with a Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8 lens, the gold standard for portrait photography. The lens is set to f/2.0 to create a beautifully shallow depth of field that isolates the subject from the background while maintaining tack-sharp focus on the eyes. ISO is set to 100 for maximum image quality and dynamic range. Shutter speed is 1/160s to eliminate any motion blur while maintaining natural appearance. The image is rendered in photorealistic 8K resolution with exceptional detail in every element - individual strands of hair, the subtle texture of skin with visible pores and natural imperfections, fine details in fabric and accessories. The color grading maintains natural skin tones with subtle warmth, professional contrast that adds depth without looking overprocessed. The background is a smooth, neutral gradient that provides separation without distraction. Post-processing includes subtle skin retouching that maintains natural texture while removing temporary blemishes, color correction for accurate representation, and contrast optimization that enhances depth. The final image has the quality of a high-end editorial portrait suitable for magazine covers or luxury brand campaigns. Style & Atmosphere: Capturing Sun-kissed luxury with emphasis on dimensionality and structure. The mood is engaging and dynamic, showing the subject's charisma from a new perspective. The aesthetic maintains the luxury feel while adding depth and sophistication. This angle provides crucial three-dimensional information that helps maintain consistency when the subject is viewed from different perspectives in generated content. Critical Requirements: This image must show photorealistic quality with natural skin texture - every pore, fine line, and natural imperfection should be visible. Hair must appear as individual strands with natural variation. Eyes must have realistic catchlights and depth. The image should look like it was captured by a master portrait photographer, not generated by AI. Facial features must be consistent and distinctive, creating a recognizable individual who maintains their appearance across all three reference images. No artificial smoothness, no plastic appearance, no exaggerated features - only authentic, natural beauty captured with technical excellence.

# Save as: char_010_face_02.png
# Description: Three-quarter angle showing dimensionality

Subject: Professional portrait photograph of PRIYA SHARMA, a 25-year-old South Asian woman with Indian heritage. Physical Description: She stands 5'6" tall with a Slim with feminine curves Her hair is dark brown in color, long in length and straight in texture, cascading down past her shoulders, flowing naturally with subtle movement Her eyes are brown and almond-shaped, deep and expressive with warm undertones, drawing attention with their natural allure She has beautiful, natural skin with even texture and healthy appearance Her face has an oval with defined features, creating a naturally photogenic silhouette Composition & Pose: Composition: Elegant three-quarter view with PRIYA SHARMA's body at a 45-degree angle to the camera while head turns back toward the lens, creating a dynamic yet natural pose. This positioning reveals the full structure of the face while maintaining eye contact with the viewer. The composition emphasizes cheekbones and jawline through the angular perspective, adding dimension and visual interest. Shoulders remain relaxed with a subtle turn that creates elegant lines. Expression features a gentle, engaging smile that reaches the eyes, creating warmth and approachability. This angle is universally flattering and provides excellent reference for three-dimensional facial structure. Lighting: Rembrandt-style lighting with key light positioned at 45 degrees to the subject's left side and elevated 30 degrees above eye level. This creates the characteristic triangular highlight on the cheek opposite the light source, adding depth and dimension to the facial structure. A silver reflector on the shadow side provides controlled fill at approximately 2:1 lighting ratio. A subtle hair light from behind and above adds separation and dimension to the hair. The lighting sculpts the face, emphasizing cheekbones and creating a sense of three-dimensionality while maintaining a flattering, approachable quality. Technical Specifications: Captured with professional-grade equipment using a Sony A7R IV full-frame mirrorless camera paired with a Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8 lens, the gold standard for portrait photography. The lens is set to f/2.0 to create a beautifully shallow depth of field that isolates the subject from the background while maintaining tack-sharp focus on the eyes. ISO is set to 100 for maximum image quality and dynamic range. Shutter speed is 1/160s to eliminate any motion blur while maintaining natural appearance. The image is rendered in photorealistic 8K resolution with exceptional detail in every element - individual strands of hair, the subtle texture of skin with visible pores and natural imperfections, fine details in fabric and accessories. The color grading maintains natural skin tones with subtle warmth, professional contrast that adds depth without looking overprocessed. The background is a smooth, neutral gradient that provides separation without distraction. Post-processing includes subtle skin retouching that maintains natural texture while removing temporary blemishes, color correction for accurate representation, and contrast optimization that enhances depth. The final image has the quality of a high-end editorial portrait suitable for magazine covers or luxury brand campaigns. Style & Atmosphere: Capturing Spiritual and serene with emphasis on dimensionality and structure. The mood is engaging and dynamic, showing the subject's charisma from a new perspective. The aesthetic maintains the luxury feel while adding depth and sophistication. This angle provides crucial three-dimensional information that helps maintain consistency when the subject is viewed from different perspectives in generated content.

This angle provides crucial three-dimensional information that helps maintain consistency when the subject is viewed from different perspectives in generated content. Critical Requirements: This image must show photorealistic quality with natural skin texture - every pore, fine line, and natural imperfection should be visible. Hair must appear as individual strands with natural variation. Eyes must have realistic catchlights and depth. The image should look like it was captured by a master portrait photographer, not generated by AI. Facial features must be consistent and distinctive, creating a recognizable individual who maintains their appearance across all three reference images. No artificial smoothness, no plastic appearance, no exaggerated features - only authentic, natural beauty captured with technical excellence.

# Save as: char_019_face_02.png
# Description: Three-quarter angle showing dimensionality

Subject: Professional portrait photograph of EBONY JACKSON, a 28-year-old Mixed woman with American heritage. Physical Description: She stands 5'6" tall with a Slim with feminine curves Her hair is dark brown in color, long in length and straight in texture, cascading down past her shoulders, flowing naturally with subtle movement Her eyes are brown and almond-shaped, deep and expressive with warm undertones, drawing attention with their natural allure She has beautiful deep melanin-rich skin with natural radiance Her face has an oval with defined features, creating a naturally photogenic silhouette Composition & Pose: Composition: Elegant three-quarter view with EBONY JACKSON's body at a 45-degree angle to the camera while head turns back toward the lens, creating a dynamic yet natural pose. This positioning reveals the full structure of the face while maintaining eye contact with the viewer. The composition emphasizes cheekbones and jawline through the angular perspective, adding dimension and visual interest. Shoulders remain relaxed with a subtle turn that creates elegant lines. Expression features a gentle, engaging smile that reaches the eyes, creating warmth and approachability. This angle is universally flattering and provides excellent reference for three-dimensional facial structure. Lighting: Rembrandt-style lighting with key light positioned at 45 degrees to the subject's left side and elevated 30 degrees above eye level. This creates the characteristic triangular highlight on the cheek opposite the light source, adding depth and dimension to the facial structure. A silver reflector on the shadow side provides controlled fill at approximately 2:1 lighting ratio. A subtle hair light from behind and above adds separation and dimension to the hair. The lighting sculpts the face, emphasizing cheekbones and creating a sense of three-dimensionality while maintaining a flattering, approachable quality. Technical Specifications: Captured with professional-grade equipment using a Sony A7R IV full-frame mirrorless camera paired with a Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8 lens, the gold standard for portrait photography. The lens is set to f/2.0 to create a beautifully shallow depth of field that isolates the subject from the background while maintaining tack-sharp focus on the eyes. ISO is set to 100 for maximum image quality and dynamic range. Shutter speed is 1/160s to eliminate any motion blur while maintaining natural appearance. The image is rendered in photorealistic 8K resolution with exceptional detail in every element - individual strands of hair, the subtle texture of skin with visible pores and natural imperfections, fine details in fabric and accessories. The color grading maintains natural skin tones with subtle warmth, professional contrast that adds depth without looking overprocessed. The background is a smooth, neutral gradient that provides separation without distraction. Post-processing includes subtle skin retouching that maintains natural texture while removing temporary blemishes, color correction for accurate representation, and contrast optimization that enhances depth. The final image has the quality of a high-end editorial portrait suitable for magazine covers or luxury brand campaigns.
